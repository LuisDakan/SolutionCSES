This problem reduces to eliminating numbers from a range from 1 to n. Now you can do that either with a boolean array of size n or with a set data structure. Boolen array is faster but this problems acts as an introduction to sets, so I recommend you to read this reference and more about. Reading the article should be enough for solving this problem.
